This project is one of the final projects required to receive the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Certificate. <br/>
<ol>
  <li>Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.</li>
  <li>Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.</li>
  <li>Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</li>
  <li>User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.</li>
  <li>User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.</li>
  <li>User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.</li>
  <li>Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.</li>
  <li>When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.</li>
</ol>
